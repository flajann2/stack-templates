* Note Well
  I have "hijacked" the stack-templates repo
  so that I can configure it to my own liking, 
  like using .org instead of .md, MIT as 
  a default license, etc.

  This is a Work In Progress, so many of
  the .hsfiles may not have been altered by me.

  You are welcome to use this or fork this for 
  your own projects if you like, but keep in mind
  I will not be maintaining this for anyone besides
  myself.

  That policy may change in the near future.

** My basic mods
   Currently, they are all in basic.hsfiles.
